# About

This is my React playground.
Here I dabble with react and associated technologies. - Storybook - Emotion - Typescript - Vite

# Workflow

- Make a copy of AppTemplate
- Paste it somewhere in src
- Change the App import in the main.tsx
- npm run rev
- Start Dabbling

# Essential Extensions

- Console Ninja

# TODO

- Storybook: Stories101
- Typescript EverydayTypes/Union
- ReactTS

# Notes

## To add storybook

`npx sb init --builder @storybook/builder-vite`

Note:
Had to add this command to run storybook
`export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`
